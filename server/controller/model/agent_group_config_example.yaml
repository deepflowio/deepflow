    ##   L2End = true is matched when generating the flow. Set this value to true to

    ##   exactly equal MAC addresses.

  ## TAP MAC Mapping Script
  ## Note: The MAC address mapping relationship of TAP NIC in complex environment can be

  ##   script:
  ##   1. if_mac_source = 2

  ## BPF ##

  ## BPF Filter
  ## Note: It is found that there may be bugs in BPF traffic filtering under some
  ##   versions of Linux Kernel. After this configuration is enabled, deepflow-agent
  ##   will not use the filtering capabilities of BPF, and will filter by itself after
  ##   capturing full traffic. Note that this may significantly increase the resource
  ##   overhead of deepflow-agent.

  ## L7 Protocol ##
  #################
  ## Maximum Fail Count
  ## Note: deepflow-agent will mark the application protocol for each
  ##   <vpc, ip, protocol, port> tuple, when the traffic corresponding to a tuple fails
  ##   to be identified for many times (for multiple packets, Socket Data, Function Data),
  ##   the tuple will be marked as an unknown type to avoid deepflow-agent continuing to
  ##   try (incurring significant computational overhead) until the duration exceeds
  ##   l7-protocol-inference-ttl.
  #l7-protocol-inference-max-fail-count: 5

  ## TTL of Protocol Identification
  ## Unit: second
  ## Note: deepflow-agent will mark the application protocol for each
  ##   <vpc, ip, protocol, port> tuple. In order to avoid misidentification caused by IP
  ##   changes, the validity period after successfully identifying the protocol will be
  ##   limited to this value.
  #l7-protocol-inference-ttl: 60

  ## List of Application Protocols
  ## Note: Turning off some protocol identification can reduce deepflow-agent resource consumption.
  ##   ProtobufRPC is disabled by default, note that ebpf-kprobe-whitelist must be configured to enable it.

  ## Note: Whether to compress the integrated data received by deepflow-agent. Currently,
