// TAP: Traffic Access Point
//
// Indicates the flow data collection location.  Currently supports 256
// acquisition locations. The traffic in cloud is uniformly represented by
// a special value `3`, and the other values represent the traffic
// collected from optical splitting and mirroring at different locations
// in the IDC.
//
// Note: For historical reasons, we use the confusing term VTAP to refer
// to deepflow-agent, and vtap_id to represent the id of a deepflow-agent.
