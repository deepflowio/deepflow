- **FAQ**. Under this directory is a list of some common problems encountered by most users, please read here before you have any questions.

- **Guides**. If this repositories brings you unexpected surprises or help, and you want to leave your mark on it, start with these guides.

- **Protocols**. These protocols tell us how DeepFlow communicates and collaborates internally, and help you better understand how signals are collected and processed.
